 "Simulated QUantim wIREs", a quantum circuit simulator for Java
 
 This project is a work in progress; while I believe it to be functional within its limits, I have yet to devise more rigorous tests. 

 I have not yet developed documentation for this project; if you are interested in using it, please take a look at the test banks for the quantum circuit simulator (src/squire/test/QuantumCircuitTests.java). These should show the basic gates needed to construct most simple circuits, as well as how to run the circuits. For a list of all gates included so far, please see the methods in the QuantumCircuitSimulator class.
