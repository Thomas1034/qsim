 "Simulated QUantim wIREs", a quantum circuit simulator for Java

[Javadoc](https://thomas1034.github.io/squire/doc/squire/module-summary.html)
 
 This project is a work in progress; while I believe it to be functional within its limits, I have yet to devise more rigorous tests. The Javadocs so far have been primarily written (with some editing) by ChatGPT; please create an [issue](https://github.com/Thomas1034/squire/issues/new/choose) if you find a description that is confusing, incomplete, inaccurate, or outright incorrect.

 I have not yet developed full documentation for this project; if you are interested in using it, please take a look at the test banks for the quantum circuit simulator here: [src/squire/test/QuantumCircuitTests.java](https://github.com/Thomas1034/squire/blob/main/src/squire/test/QuantumCircuitTests.java). These should show the basic gates needed to construct most simple circuits, as well as how to run the circuits. For a list of all gates included so far, please see the methods in the [QuantumCircuitSimulator](https://thomas1034.github.io/squire/doc/squire/squire/circuit/QuantumCircuitSimulator.html) class.

 Please leave comments, criticisms, and feature requests using the "Issues" tab of this repository. I can't improve this without your feedback!
